I'm a physicist turned machine learning engineer. I worked in particle physics at Universidad de los Andes and materials science at Purdue University during my undergrad. I've been working in industry for ~5 years in multiple areas related to machine learning such as NLP, recommender systems, and computer vision.

I'm mainly interested in building machine learning systems that can learn from human experts either through inductive biases or reinforcement learning from human feedback.
