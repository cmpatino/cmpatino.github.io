I'm a physicist turned machine learning engineer. I worked in particle physics at Universidad de los Andes and materials science at Purdue University during my undergrad. I've been working in industry for 6+ years in multiple areas related to machine learning such as NLP, recommender systems, and computer vision. My last position was as a Staff Machine Learning Engineer at [Factored](https://factored.ai), and I'm currently working in post-training @ Hugging Face and pursuing a MSc in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Amsterdam.

I'm mainly interested in building AI systems that can learn from and collaborate with human experts and developing systems that can scale human expertise by merging research and software engineering.
