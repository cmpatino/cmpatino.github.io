<blockquote>
  <p>If you have an imbalanced dataset of a ratio 1:10 of positives:negatives, set the bias on your logits such that your network predicts probability of 0.1 at initialization. Setting these correctly will speed up convergence and eliminate “hockey stick” loss curves where in the first few iteration your network is basically just learning the bias.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have used his advice to initialize my binary classifiers and, so far, have achieved good results. However, I never stopped to test whether initializing the bias with that recommendation helped model performance significantly. This post aims to answer that question with a quick experiment.</p>

<h2 id="the-setup">The Setup</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Dataset</strong>: We are going to use the <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html">CIFAR10 dataset</a> with a twist. The twist is that we want to benchmark the bias initialization in a binary task, but CIFAR10 has ten classes. We will follow the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWwCK95X6go">Hot Dog-Not Hot Dog</a> approach to turn the task into a binary classification problem. We don’t have hot dogs in CIFAR10, so we will train a model that classifies Frog-Not Frog.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Model</strong>: We used <a href="https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/models/generated/torchvision.models.efficientnet_b1.html#torchvision.models.EfficientNet_B1_Weights">EfficientNet B1</a> with ~7.8M parameters available in torchvision. This model strikes a good balance between speed and performance: it is small enough to run multiple experiments quickly but performs well, as measured by its acc@1 of 79.838 on ImageNet. We ran experiments with and without pre-trained ImageNet weights to check whether the pre-training impacted our results.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Training</strong>: We trained each model for five epochs and repeated each training process ten times to account for randomness in initialization and training. The optimizer is the vanilla SGD with a learning rate of 0.0001. You can see all the training details in this <a href="https://github.com/cmpatino/substack/blob/main/output_bias_init/main.py">GitHub link</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Hardware</strong>: We ran the experiments in a T4 GPU, which is right for this experiment because the model and the data aren’t too large. Training the two models ten times each costs less than USD 10 on a single T4. I ran everything using <a href="https://lightning.ai/studios">Lightning Studios</a>, which has proven great for quickly spinning up instances with GPUs and running experiments.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<h5 id="imagenet-weights">ImageNet Weights</h5>

<p>The first experiment was to train the model using the pre-trained ImageNet weights. The learning curve at epoch 0 shows how initializing the model at the positive class rate starts with a lower loss before training the model. However, the model with the vanilla initialization quickly closes the gap, and both models have identical performance by the 5th training epoch.</p>

<p>Despite both models achieving nearly identical performance after a few epochs, the positive rate initialization avoids the hockey stick shape in the learning curve. This head start in the loss may be crucial for larger datasets or models you can’t afford to train for multiple epochs.</p>

<h5 id="trained-without-imagenet-weights">Trained without ImageNet Weights</h5>

<p>The second experiment was to train the model without the pre-trained ImageNet weights. The first—perhaps expected—conclusion is that we have a harder time training the model without the ImageNet weights. Both initializations achieved less than 0.9 ROC-AUC in the fifth epoch, while the model with ImageNet weights was already close to perfect ROC-AUC at that point in training.</p>

<p>As before, the positive rate initialization has a head start from the model initialized with the vanilla output bias. If we focus on the ROC-AUC learning curve, the red curve has a harder time catching up with the blue curve up to the third epoch. This indicates that the advantage given by the positive rate initialization is more valuable in the case of models without pre-trained weights.</p>

<p>What’s interesting about the plot below is how the vanilla initialization model surpasses the positive rate initialization model. None of the two models have converged, but you would benefit from choosing the vanilla initialization if your FLOPs budget only allowed for training five epochs.</p>

<p>To compare the model with the pre-trained weights, we trained both models without the ImageNet weights until they converged. The plots below are just from training the models twice instead of ten as from the previous two plots.</p>

<p>The conclusion is the same as with the ImageNet weights: both models achieve similar metrics if we can afford to train them to convergence.</p>

<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>

<p>Initializing the bias in the model’s output layer with the positive class rate, as Karpathy mentions in his guide, avoids the hockey stick shape in the learning curve. This head start proves useful when your FLOPs budget can only afford a few training epochs. However, the model initialized with the vanilla method closes the gap quickly for the pre-trained model and after a few epochs for the model trained from scratch.</p>

<p>Also, always use pre-trained weights when possible! The strongest conclusion from this set of runs is that models with pre-trained weights converge significantly faster than models trained from scratch.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Should you initialize the bias in the output layer to predict the positive rate?]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Why is Numpy Faster than Pure Python?</title><link href="https://cmpatino.github.io/blog/2024/numpy-vs-python/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Why is Numpy Faster than Pure Python?" /><published>2024-02-02T08:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-02-02T08:20:00+00:00</updated><id>https://cmpatino.github.io/blog/2024/numpy-vs-python</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://cmpatino.github.io/blog/2024/numpy-vs-python/"><![CDATA[<p><strong>TLDR</strong>; Numpy leverages contiguous memory allocation and vectorizes operations over entire arrays.</p>

<p>I’ve used Numpy since my early programming days in Python during my undergrad in physics. I was taught we should always use Numpy when dealing with numeric computations like matrix multiplication. I knew Numpy has optimized C implementations of some operations, but I wanted to dig deeper into what’s going on under the hood to make Numpy more efficient than pure Python for matrix-like structures. After all, Python also runs C in the background.</p>

<p>I found good answers in the <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/high-performance-python/9781492055013/">High Performance Python book</a>, which I decided to summarize in this post.</p>

<h2 id="vectorization">Vectorization</h2>

<p>Let’s assume for a moment that we can have all the data we need to run an operation on the CPU. Vectorization is a process where you apply the same operation simultaneously to multiple elements. For example, you can multiply parts of arrays at once instead of multiplying element by element.</p>

<p>The caveat of vectorized operations is that they run on a different part of the CPU and with different instructions than non-vectorized operations. Python doesn’t leverage vectorized operations that are possible in the CPU, so Numpy has specialized code that takes advantage of the vectorizations enabled by the CPU. That’s why vectorization is one of the reasons Numpy is faster than pure Python.</p>

<p>Fragmented memory results in irrelevant data (green squares) in each memory transfer, so we need more memory transfers to pass the relevant data (blue squares) to the CPU cache.</p>

<p>We now know that vectorization requires all the data in the CPU. However, CPUs have limited memory, so we need to figure out how to transfer data between the RAM and the CPU’s cache.</p>

<p>Python lists and Numpy arrays handle data differently. Python lists store pointers to the data; meaning lists don’t hold the data we care about. Storing pointers of the data allows Python to hold multiple types of data in a list, resulting in our relevant data being fragmented in different memory locations. This fragmentation is fine for most cases, but a potential optimization becomes clear when we understand communications between the RAM and the CPU.</p>

<p>The data we use is initially stored in RAM and then moved to the CPU when we need to run calculations with that data. Communication between the two devices is costly in terms of time, so CPUs have a cache memory where they can store data they know they will require to run the calculations we request. That’s why the CPU tries to predict which data will be required and tries to transfer that data to its cache. The CPU usually makes this prediction well (using techniques like branch prediction and pipelining), so the real bottleneck is moving data quickly between the RAM and the CPU cache.</p>

<p>Transferring between the RAM and the CPU cache—also known as the L1/L2 cache—is done by a bus that transfers memory in blocks. We usually want to run an operation over the entire object for data structures like matrices, so we know that, eventually, we want to transfer all the elements in the matrix to the CPU. If the data we want to use is fragmented across our RAM, the transferred blocks will contain pieces that are not relevant to our calculation. If our data is stored in contiguous blocks, most of our data will be relevant to the calculation. That’s why we need fewer transfer operations than in the fragmented memory case. Using contiguous memory gets our relevant data to the CPU faster, and this optimization results in faster runtimes. You can see a comparison of the two cases in the diagram below.</p>

<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>

<p>Python is a very flexible language, but that flexibility often comes with a price we pay in performance. In our case, Python allows having lists containing elements of different types, which are challenging to store in contiguous memory without causing issues. Numpy then enforces elements in an array to be the same type to speed up calculations by reducing data transfers and leveraging vectorization. That limitation of having arrays of the same data type can be limiting for some use cases but isn’t a problem for numeric computing. That’s why Numpy works great for handling operations between numerical tensors and is faster than pure Python for those cases.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[TLDR; Numpy leverages contiguous memory allocation and vectorizes operations over entire arrays.]]></summary></entry></feed>
